Well done for taking the time to complete the course.

This course aimed to provide a practical framework for supporting the writing of analysis in social care records. We hope this course will have offered you a chance to clarify how you think about your writing at work, and help you to spend some time reflecting on what exactly is involved in the writing of analysis in your everyday practice. By working through the course, you should now

1. Have become familiar with one practical framework for supporting the writing of analysis
2. Have considered some aspects of the language of written analysis
3. Have reflected on your own practice of writing analysis
