## Writing in Social Work Practice

[WiSPeR is a collection of resources](https://wisper.writinginsocialwork.com) developed to help practitioners to write more effectively in practice contexts and to encourage debate about the role of writing in professional social work.

All of the resources on the site are free to use and will be of use to social work students, early career social workers as well as managers, trainers and educators who support them.

## Iriss resources

On this page you'll find a collection of [Iriss resources about recording practice in social services](https://www.iriss.org.uk/collection/recording-practice), including articles, learning reports and tools. During 2019/20 we worked with [East Ayrshire Health & Social Care Partnership](https://www.east-ayrshire.gov.uk/SocialCareAndHealth/East-Ayrshire-Health-and-Social-Care-Partnership/East-Ayrshire-Health-and-Social-Care-Partnership.aspx) to explore recording practice from a cross-service perspective and in 2020/21 we continued to build on this work and take it in new directions. As new resources are produced we'll add them to this collection.

## Language in social work on Iriss FM

Is use of language something you carefully consider as a social worker? Is language important to social work practice?

Sara Hitchin, Senior Lecturer in Social Work at the University of Stirling certainly thinks so and has written [an article](https://www.scopt.co.uk/archives/4966) about it for the Scottish Organisation for Practice Teaching(Scopt).

Michelle from Iriss went along to University of Stirling to have a conversation with her about the importance of language and its relationship to social work values.
