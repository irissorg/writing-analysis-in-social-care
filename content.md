# Writing Analysis in Social Care

Author: Josie Vallely

# Overview

Find yourself running a partnership or group work project where the participants can’t physically be together? Expand your knowledge, increase your confidence and write a practical project plan to get you started. 

This resource explores how we can work together as a mixed group of decision makers, staff members, and people with lived experience, when it is not practical for you to all be in the same room. It builds on our suite of co-production and partnership resources, including our co-production planner.

The course will help you create a practical project plan and use tools that help us to connect across distance. It was initially put together in response to the COVID-19 lockdown, but it will be relevant for anyone running a collaborative project in circumstances which means that people cannot be together easily. This could include working with an international group, in a rural setting, or with people who may find it easier to contribute from home. 

There are advantages to exploring the approaches to working together apart – working remotely can make efficient use of time; not all meetings really need to be in person. Virtual meetings can be inclusive if they mean folk can get involved who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend a meeting in a particular location. There are instances where remote working can save money on travel, room hire and catering, and some participants may feel more comfortable engaging at a distance. Learning how to successfully ‘work together apart’ will open up opportunities that you may not have realised existed, in terms of who and how you engage.

Each section of the course is short and succinct to help you get an overview and feel ready to get started on your own process. We have included optional ‘read, listen, watch’ resources at the end of each section if you are interested in going a little deeper into the subject. There are also a number of exercises to complete at the end of each section to help you assess your own understanding and learning, and to help you capture your thoughts in relation to your own project.

# Introduction

## Aims of course

In this course we will  focus on how you can create spaces for collaborative working  when you cannot be together with the people you are working with. By working through the course and completing the activities at the end of each unit, you will end the course with a project plan that includes:

* Project values - what makes your project unique. What will success look like?
* Expressing your values - thinking about ways to communicate your values. When we are working on projects that will be remote, it is really important to consider how we can make then stand out. 
* The drivers of your project: gaps, strengths, risks - work through the following conversation prompts with your project team or on your own.
* Your asset bank - what resources do you have already to support your remote project idea?  
* Power dynamics - in terms of your project focus, who tends to be impacted by decisions that are made, and who tends to make those decisions?
*   Who is who? - who will be involved in the project.
*   Addressing power imbalance - identify barriers to inclusion and ideas for overcoming them.
*   Trust builder - effective group working  is about relationships and trust. This is even more crucial if you will be working remotely.
*   Staying connected - for a remote project communication strategy there are hundreds of different digital tools that you can use to facilitate your project and stay connected. Which of these will you use at the different stages of your project? 
*   Digital comfort zone - reflect on how you could do some more focused learning to help build your confidence with digital tools.
*   Create a cultural probe - cultural probes work by revealing small insights into peoples’ lives, which can then inspire a group to come up with new ideas. Make your own for the project.
*   Session plan - a place to think about and plan your individual sessions.
*   Project planning timeline - using the timeline tool, visually map out what you will need to do, when, and what resources you will need to do it. 
*   Exploring evaluation -  how will you measure the success of the project?

In addition to this practical project plan you will have a greater understanding of how to make distance working more accessible, inclusive, meaningful and rewarding. You will also have a better understanding of the landscape of tools and technologies that are available to support your work.

If you are confident about your project planning and are looking for more specific guidance about facilitating online discussion, we recommend you explore the [Online training tools toolbox](https://www.trainingforchange.org/tools/?topic%5B2%5D=2&searchbox=) by Training for Change. 


## Practical tips for completing the course

You can complete the course in the way that suits your learning style. This may mean that you work through the activities in a linear way from beginning to end. Alternatively you may find it easier to dip in and out of the course depending on what stage of your project planning you are at.

Each unit provides an overview which is followed by a practical exercise to complete. The activities for each unit will contribute to your project plan. 

The summary in each unit will give you enough understanding to work through the course. If you are interested in learning more or seeing the principles in action, we have included a number of multimedia links.

Due to the nature of this course, there will be a significant focus on technologies that can support distant working. Many of these technologies and platforms will be familiar to you and some will not. We are aware that everybody has different levels of digital literacy, access to technology and that digital solutions may not always be suitable for your group. To address this, we have included non-digital options. 

If you would like personal support using these technologies, Iriss is offering  [free support](https://www.iriss.org.uk/coronavirus-covid-19/helpme) to organisations who may be facing challenges in terms of technology during the COVID-19 pandemic.


# Why work together?

By the end of this unit you will have completed exercises exploring:



*   Project values - what makes your project unique. What will success look like?
*   Expressing your values - thinking about ways to communicate your values. When we are working on projects that will be remote, it is really important to consider how we can make then stand out. 
*   The drivers of your project: gaps, strengths, risks - work through the following conversation prompts with your project team or on your own.
*   Your asset bank - what resources do you have already to support your remote project idea?


## Embedding values

When challenges are presented, such as distance, time, or the unique circumstances of a global pandemic, we can find ourselves de-prioritising working  together. All kinds of group work – whether it be partnerships across organisations or co-production processes involving many different types of people – require a commitment from those leading projects. So why make the extra effort to make projects participative despite barriers to doing so?

The many positive aspects of working together to make change and the need for working together is enshrined in policy in Scotland.

“Participation is a priority for the delivery of high-quality health and social services. Policy such as the Health and Social Care Delivery Plan (Scottish Government, 2016) and 2020 vision set out for health and social care in Scotland (Scottish Government, 2013) have highlighted the need for participation in health and social care in Scotland. 

It is now recognised within policy that participation must be an essential part of social care. One of the four main principles in the Christie commission (2011) is that public services must facilitate the empowerment of individuals and the wider community by involving them in the design and delivery of care.

The Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014 highlighted the need for services to be person-centred, with the community influencing the planning and delivery of services. In addition, the National Health and Social Workforce Plan, the Scottish Social Service Council (SSSC) codes of practice, and the Community Empowerment Act (2015) all state that there must be systems in place to get feedback from PWUS, their carers and families, and the public, to support the design and delivery of high-quality public services.”  

- [Gail McMillan](https://www.iriss.org.uk/authors/gail-mcmillan) ([Participation: its impact on services and the people who use them](https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/insights/participation-its-impact-services-and-people-who-use-them))

If we consider a human rights based approach to social care delivery, one of the key principles of this is participation. People who use services have unique insights into their successes and failures. It is only this knowledge and working together that we will be able to deliver services that truly meet the needs of the people using them.


## Co-production

Iriss promotes co-production as a gold standard of participation, and one of the best ways to create change in social care. Co-production is a way of working with, rather than doing to, people and communities to achieve better outcomes. A co-production project sees people who access support as assets and builds on people’s existing capabilities. In addition, it breaks down the barriers between people who use services and professionals. 

Co-production is called for when solutions need to be found that rely on knowledge from multiple sources, where each member of the co-production team has a skill or knowledge that the other team members need in order to find solutions (Durose, 2017). 

Co-production projects are planned, developed and delivered by a group of people who have different backgrounds and interests. The outputs of a co-production process can be huge – services, processes and pathways; or small – a community hall’s furniture, a poster or a blog page. 

Co-production sets the bar higher than standard participation. It relies on shifting power towards people who use services and carers, who must be included in a co-production team. However, in order for successful implementation of change it is equally important that the team includes relevant frontline workers, practitioners, managers  and has buy-in from decision-makers.

It may be that in the current circumstances you are in, it is not possible to bring  together a full co-production team. We would encourage you to hold the model of co-production as the gold standard of participation and, where you can, work to this model. This may involve using a variety of strategies to engage different people in your project work. 

Iriss promotes bringing the members of a co-production team together to have conversations and to learn from one another. This allows for dialogue to be opened up and creates space for new ideas to grow from the cross-pollination of experiences. Things are possible even if we are not able to all be together in the same room. It is important that where possible we are still taking the time to work together so that we can maintain a person-centred and human rights based approach to service design and delivery.


## Working in partnership

While co-production is used to describe processes where there is a mixed group of people collaborating, sometimes a project requires collaborative working between organisations. The project plan you develop during this course can be used interchangeably between co-production, partnership and workplace projects. It is up to you to work out what will be best suited to your situation. This  course offers some adapted questions from our [Partnerships & Co tool](https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/tools/partnerships-co).


## Articulating the value of your project

The best way to engage people in your project and recruit group members  is to be able to clearly articulate the aims of your project and its values. There are many ways to do this and some are more obvious than others.



1. Before you approach other people about the project, have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve and what the limitations of your project are. It is as important to identify the boundaries of your project as it is to focus on the big dreams that you hope to achieve. This shows people that you have thought through the impact of the work and are not going to try and bite off more than you can chew.
2. Find multiple ways of communicating the values of the project. Try a written statement,  recording presentations or videos, and social media.
3. Develop clear branding that people can associate with the project so that they can quickly identify work associated with it.
4. It helps to have the first steps of your evaluation already in place at the beginning of the project. This will help you let people know how you will measure the success of the project and what outcomes you are hoping to achieve. It also shows how you will measure the success of the project which can be inspiring in itself. Have a plan of what you want to do next if the project falls through or doesn't work out as planned.
5. If there are other similar projects that have happened elsewhere, share these examples with participants at the beginning. This can help them visualise how their input can support the project.
6. Create a narrative around your project. Look at the bigger picture and try to paint a story of how the project will change people's experiences and lives.
7. Identify what is unique about the project.


### Why work together - tools

Project values - what makes your project unique. What will success look like? 

Expressing your values - thinking about ways to communicate your values. When we are working on projects that will be remote, it is really important to consider how we can make then stand out. 

The drivers of your project: gaps, strengths, risks - work through the following conversation prompts with your project team or on your own.

Your asset bank - what resources do you have already to support your remote project idea?

# Gathering a group

By the end of this unit you will have completed exercises exploring:



*   Power dynamics - in terms of your project focus, who tends to be impacted by decisions that are made, and who tends to make those decisions?
*   Who is who? - who will be involved in the project.
    *   Take some time to complete the people finder tool. This tool will help you clarify how you can make connections with the people that you need to be involved in your project.
    *   What strengths / expertise does each individual person bring? 
    *   What qualities and expertise do you think make for a good participant and why?
    *   What relationships already exist between individual participants? Are there any issues / threats (perceived and real) of competition between partners?
*   Addressing power imbalance - identify barriers to inclusion and ideas for overcoming them.
*   Trust builder - effective group working  is about relationships and trust. This is even more crucial if you will be working remotely.

Collaboration begins with a group. This group will be made up of professionals and individuals who have lived experience of the area that is being explored. This group defines the research question. Usually this question already has some direction from initial project ideas, funding directives or recognised need, but ideally everyone in the group has a chance to contribute. When the focus has been agreed, the group can embark on the project.

This is a collection of people that represent all the stakeholders in the project. It could include staff from relevant organisations, people with lived experience, managers, key decision makers, family members, carers – the mix will be different for each project.  We usually say that co-production can only work if you have all the right people in the room, but  in current circumstances, we will be looking to gather this group in a more virtual form. This will present challenges, but will also remove barriers, so it is an ideal opportunity to learn how to make a project process accessible to people who may otherwise struggle to join a physical group.

Done well, group work can support organisations and individuals to become agents for change. 

Co-production relies on shifting power towards people who use services and carers, and they must be included in a production team. However, in order for successful implementation of change it is equally important that the team includes relevant frontline workers, practitioners, managers, and has buy-in from decision-makers.

There is currently a sense of urgency in terms of service improvement and delivery. However, we have to be realistic about time required for improvement. It takes time to gather together the right people to make good group work happen, so make sure you manage your expectations and leave plenty of time for recruitment. We need to get this first aspect right as it is the foundation of everything that will come next. There must be flexibility in the process for the team members, a certain amount of ‘give’ in the solutions that are sought. An element of commitment to the project is required from professionals and people bringing lived experience – without this the project will fail, or simply recreate similar power dynamics that would have arisen from other methodologies. Inherent in this commitment is the need for incentives for everyone in the team to continue the project through to fruition. People involved in the co-production process must get something back for having done something for others. 


## Finding people

Finding people to join your group can be an exciting and daunting task. Aim for equal numbers of professionals and individuals with lived experience (including carers, family members etc). 

Finding people with lived experience can be difficult if they face barriers to inclusion. By identifying these barriers before you begin recruiting, you will be more likely to overcome them. Recruiting people who have influence over the implementation and funding of ideas can take a long time and involve winning trust. You may be looking to answer a question that people have very different opinions about. Taking time to make sure you have representatives from all camps is essential to your project's success. Think about the size of the group – beyond twenty is too many, less than six is too small.  

One of the questions we are often asked when we talk about finding the right people for a group, is where to find them. This will be unique to your project. In the context of working together apart, it may be that you are best placed to begin your search online. Forums, Facebook groups, Twitter and other digital networks can be good places to link up with people. Just because you can't be in the same physical space doesn't mean that the social networks around these spaces are not still active. Contacting churches, schools, youth groups and social centres to tell them about your project can be a great place to start. 

Set the following questions when thinking about how to recruit people for your project:



*   What are the characteristics of the people you need on your production team? Be specific.
*   Where do they congregate? Is there a group that physically meets in the same place?  Is it geographically linked?  Does it have a community of practice or online presence?  Are there advocacy groups that link people up?  Do you have personal or professional connections to people who fit the bill? 
*   How are you communicating your project?  Do you have an online presence, a point of contact or a supporting organisation?
*   Are you ready to discuss the ethics of your project and your considerations of how you will avoid exploiting people?

The recruitment process will differ from project to project. The most important thing is to be proactive and ensure your recruitment process is accessible.


## Barriers to inclusion



*   Socioeconomic status and class. Being inclusive across class means prioritising the needs of people who have been consistently told by society that they matter less. It is also about recognising the financial pressures of precarious work (poorly paid, unprotected, and insecure) and unemployment. Some people may not be able to get time off work, so accommodate them by being flexible with the times of  your meetings. If you are working with people who have children, then consider whether they need support with childcare, or make it clear that children are welcome in the background of any meetings. Cover expenses for your participants – it is best practice to provide these up front. If you can, pay your non-salaried participants a day rate. If the professionals in your group are being paid to take part then everybody should be. Be aware of the impact that payments and volunteering can have on people’s benefits, and find creative ways to navigate these systems.
*   Language and literacy levels are an important consideration in recruitment and throughout the project, so avoid jargon and use plain English. Not only is this inclusive, but it supports and builds understanding between professions from different sectors and across boundaries between professionals and non-professional. If the group has varied literacy skills, try alternative forms of media such as radio or video. Providing a phone number is always helpful, and there are also tele-interpretation services available. There is more to making a project accessible to people without English as a first language than just translating the call-out. You will need to be able to respond to questions and provide interpretation if your participants don’t speak the same language as you. Also think about using local dialect or languages like Scots or Gaelic. 
*   In the community you are recruiting from, is decision-making done as a family, a community or individually? You may need to reach out to key community members to help. Are their significant cultural events you could recruit at? Are there particular dates  you should avoid for holding  workshops? 
*   It is everyone’s responsibility to make sure the voices of BME communities are heard and acted upon. In the 2011 census in Glasgow City, 12% of the population were from a minority ethnic group, in the City of Edinburgh and Aberdeen City it was 8%, and in Dundee City it was 6%. Your co-production team should reflect this and include BME people. Prioritise the needs of your BME participants over others. This will help to counteract the inherent barriers to inclusion that they face generally in society. 
*   Communicating with young people, adults or older adults requires different approaches. For example, you wouldn’t rely on social media to recruit older people with dementia. Think about where these communities are and consider the best ways to engage them. 
*   Think about specific commitments people may have based on their geography. For example, in very rural areas, don’t recruit during lambing. Internet access may also be more difficult in some areas of the Highlands.
*   Be sure to make your recruitment process LGBTQI friendly. Use the inclusion form to ask people to include their pronoun (he / she / they) with their name so that you don’t misgender participants. Do not let other members of the group misgender participants and have a zero tolerance approach to sexist and homophobic comments. Create a women-only co-production team for groups who need a safe space, but never exclude trans women from these spaces. When discussing support networks, ask questions like ‘who are the significant people in your life?’. Don’t focus on people’s partners or children. 
*   Is there stigma associated with the project subject? For example, substance misuse, dementia, mental health and HIV issues can be stigmatised in families and in the community. People with particular conditions may be less willing to participate for fear of others finding out. One option is to keep the name of the project neutral. The Iriss Pilotlight project that explored self-directed support (SDS) and early onset dementia was named ‘Living well’. This meant that participants could choose whether to disclose their diagnosis or not. Ensure that you have people’s explicit consent before sharing photos or identifiable information.

You may have to try lots of different avenues to recruit people. Don’t give up! If recruitment is challenging, you might want to adjust elements – group sizes, timing, commitment levels etc. If this doesn’t work, you might need to consider an alternative approach to co-production.  

If you are working with people who are cautious of authority then work may be required to build trust. Reassure people that their details will not be shared. In some situations people may prefer not to give their personal information at all.

### Gathering a group - read, listen, watch



*   ‘Hard to reach’ or ‘easy to ignore’? Groups that have been known in the past as 'hard to reach' are now more appropriately recognised as 'easy to ignore'. Those facing inequalities, sometimes multiple inequalities, are often easy to ignore due to the complexity of their situation, the difficulty of forming a solution, and a lack of understanding from governments, organisations and programmes. No one is hard to reach, just more expensive to reach. It is important to put more effort and creativity in reaching these groups ( Lightbody [, 2017](http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WWSHardToReachOrEasyToIgnoreEvidenceReview.pdf)).
*   [IGLYO intersectionality toolkit](https://www.iglyo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Inter-Toolkit.pdf). A practical guide for both individual activists and organisations to learn more about intersectionality and its principles, and to provide a selection of activities to explore practice around inclusiveness. 
*   The People-led Policy Panel is a group of people who work together to reform adult social care support in Scotland. The initiative is supported by Scottish Government. Iriss had a [conversation with Deirdre Henderson](https://podcast.iriss.org.uk/people-led-policy-panel-1), People-led Policy Officer at Inclusion Scotland about the set up, aims and ambitions of the panel. Denis Shovlin, a member of the panel, also spoke about how he got involved and his experiences of the panel. 
*   Business school professor [Amy Edmondson studies ‘teaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3boKz0Exros)’, where people come together quickly (and often temporarily) to solve new, urgent or unusual problems. Recalling stories of teamwork on the fly, such as the incredible rescue of 33 miners trapped half a mile underground in Chile in 2010, Edmondson shares the elements needed to turn a group of strangers into a quick-thinking team that can nimbly respond to challenges.


# Keeping people engaged remotely

By the end of this unit you will have completed exercises exploring:



*   Staying connected - for a remote project communication strategy there are hundreds of different digital tools that you can use to  facilitate your project and stay connected. Which of these will you use at the different stages of your project? 
*   Digital comfort zone - reflect on how you could do some more focussed learning to help build your confidence with digital tools.

When you have explored who will be involved in the project, you can consider how you will work with people. Some aspects of working together will be the same as a project where you can be together, but some will be very different if you are running the project remotely.

When running any project it is essential to stay connected with your participants throughout. From the first moment of outreach when you meet a potential participant to the point at which the project is officially complete, there are many opportunities to create meaningful connections with people involved.

Contact often focuses around building a relationship with a participant in order to encourage them to come along to a face-to-face meeting. This would allow you to build a relationship with them more organically as you got to know each other from the physical meetings. When we are ‘working together apart’ there is even more emphasis on staying connected. Given we don’t have these natural moments of coming together in the same room, we need to make extra effort to make sure that people feel involved and included. The way that you do this will be specific to your group.


## Accessibility

In order for a project to be meaningful for participants, it must be accessible.  When you have identified who you would like to be in your group, have a think about what will make the project most accessible to them and provide them with the most reward. The following [checklist from Evaluation Support Scotland](http://www.evaluationsupportscotland.org.uk/media/uploads/tsrf/evidencing_successful_co-production_in_the_third_sector_-_final.pdf) (2017) outlines some practical lessons that can be used to improve engagement with them.



*   Find out in advance about the capacity of people to engage. 
*   Build time to understand people’s readiness to engage before the start of the co-production project.
*   Ensure that the involvement of partners, particularly people with lived experience, benefits the person before benefitting the project. 
*   Consider what is feasible to achieve with the ‘people assets’ and other resources available - focus on what you can do, not what you can’t. 
*   Be flexible in terms of timescales, resources, partner availability, and even the final destination of the work. This will help to clear blockages to genuine joint working. 
*   Start conversations from what individuals and communities need.
*   Ask people how and to what degree they would like to be involved – involvement should feel comfortable and should make the most of people’s capabilities. 
*   Create opportunities for people to work towards a shared aim, interest and passion. 
*   Provide opportunities for reciprocity: giving and receiving builds trust and mutual respect, and helps build bridges. 
*   Make use of community assets and resources already available. 
*   Provide peer support opportunities for people. Reciprocity is an important motivator for volunteers. The most effective volunteers are trained and well supported.
*   Be prepared to have assumptions challenged. Bring out any uncertainties or questions into the open and explore any disconnect or ability to contribute. View these as opportunities to learn.
*   Take time and make the best use of tools available to share experiences and build relationships and trust to form your community of learners and improvers; bring their assets out into the open. 
*   Explore how any planned outputs from the project relate to improving person-centred care in the local area before investing resources. 
*   Working in a co-produced way takes time and cannot be unduly rushed. Be flexible and have fun along the way.


## Staying connected

When you first make contact with someone, find out  how they prefer to communicate, and provide a variety of options. It may be that they are digitally literate and enjoy working online or they may prefer to work over the phone, or even through the post. Depending on the needs of your participant you can begin to design your communication strategy. 

For a remote project communication strategy there are hundreds of different digital tools that you can use to  facilitate your project and stay connected. Day-to-day social media that many people use include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and email, and specific project management tools such as Slack and Zoom. Each of these have their own benefits and we have provided a short summary of some of the most common and useful resources below.

“My project ‘Reclaiming Our Heritage’ works with a group of volunteers from across Scotland. Some in more urban areas, others in more rural and remote places. It's really important for us to stay connected using digital technology and tools otherwise the project wouldn't have worked. I have found video calling apps like Zoom to be really useful. Emails are a great way to keep engaged, things like a weekly newsletter or monthly Zoom catch ups. This helps the volunteers still feel like part of the project despite not being able to physically be together in the same room. We took tools for granted before - I would have travelled previously but actually the Zoom sessions ended up being easier and more inclusive. It was difficult for people who were really far apart in the rural Highlands to make it to the sessions”  Eilidh Hollow, Project Development Officer ‑ Reclaiming Our Heritage, The Mental Health Foundation

If you are new to these technologies they can be a little overwhelming at first, but persevere and watch many of the helpful tutorials online, and you will soon get your head around them.

## Staying safe

When you are developing your communications strategy, It is important to consider GDPR regulations. This ensures that you are keeping participants informed about how you will use their data, and how you will keep it safe. If it is also important to consider the challenges that communications can pose in terms of boundaries. Some things to consider:



*   Will participants have access to each other’s contact details?  Is there a way for it to be avoided or limited?
*   Have you found a way to ensure that you do not have to provide your personal contact details to participants?  Do you have an organisational social media presence and a work phone?
*   Have you worked with participants to set some ground rules in terms of online participation?
*   Do you have support from your organisation and a plan for what to do if conflict arises? 
*   Do you have a plan about how you will manage if participants use the group communication to share personal information that may trigger a safeguarding procedure?
*   Have you considered how to create a safe online space for participants? For example, try to use the most secure Zoom settings to [avoid distressing ‘Zoom bombing](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-prevent-zoom-bombing-5-simple-tips/)’. 
*   Have you communicated to  participants that the communication (whether a Facebook group, WhatsApp group etc) will be time-limited to the project.


### Keeping people engaged - Tools


#### Staying connected

For a remote project communication strategy there are hundreds of digital tools that you can use to  facilitate your project and stay connected. Which of these will you use at each stage of your project? Remember to include more traditional communications, such as phone calls and letters, if they are applicable.


#### Digital comfort zone

Think about the digital technologies you use. Write them into your comfort zone areas.



*   Comfort zone - I use them all the time, they are second nature to me
*   Learning zone - I use them often and feel comfortable about working them out as I go
*   Scary zone - I don’t know how these work and I would rather not use them.

Use this tool to reflect on how you could do more focused learning to help build your confidence with your ‘scary’ and ‘learning’ zone digital tools.


#### Keeping people engaged - read, listen, watch



*   Digital inclusion, exclusion and participation. [ESSS Outline](https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/esss-outlines/digital-inclusion-exclusion-and-participation)
*   The internet and digital technology is very much at the heart of how public, economic and social life functions. It has transformed how we work, communicate, consume, learn, entertain and access information and public services. And while it’s become integral to all aspects of life, the spread of access and use is uneven and many people remain digitally excluded ([OIS, 2013](http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/OxIS-2013.pdf); [Selwyn 2004](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1461444804042519)). Those who are excluded can be limited or unable to participate fully in society. The social and economic gap between those who are connected and those who are not, continues to widen. ([ONS, 2019](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/articles/exploringtheuksdigitaldivide/2019-03-04/pdf); [The Wales Co-operative Centre with Carnegie UK Trust, 2018](https://d1ssu070pg2v9i.cloudfront.net/pex/carnegie_uk_trust/2019/02/12121234/Digital-Inclusion-in-Health-and-Care-in-Wales-%E2%80%93-Full-report-English-version.pdf)).
*   How much and how often you use the internet can offer an insight into who could be considered digitally excluded, providing a way to assess how the internet and digital skills impacts on people’s lives ([Good Things Foundation, 2017](https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/sites/default/files/research-publications/ofcom_report_v4_links.pdf)). [https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/esss-outlines/digital-inclusion-exclusion-and-participation](https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/esss-outlines/digital-inclusion-exclusion-and-participation)
*   Fife Voluntary Action (FVA) is delighted to have worked in close partnership with Square Peg HR to develop and make available a [GDPR Toolkit](https://www.fva.org/gdpr_toolkit.asp), which will help organisations on their journey to compliance with the new General Data Protection Regulation.


# Uncovering  knowledge and assets

By the end of this unit you will have completed exercises that will create:



*   A cultural probe  - cultural probes work by revealing small insights into peoples’ lives, which can then inspire a group to come up with new ideas
*   A session plan - a place to think about and plan your individual sessions 

When you have confirmed the idea for the project and who will be in the co-production team, it is time to start thinking, developing ideas, and come up with a plan to make change.

Facilitating opportunities for people to get together and create dialogue is at the heart of co-production. At Iriss, we call these opportunities ‘workshops’, but they are also called gatherings, meetings, sessions, skill shares and seminars. These workshops can be in-person, or as is the case with this course, using digital or other methods as discussed.

There is a lot to learn about online facilitation. We could have written a whole course on the subject. Luckily we don't have to as Train for Change has created [a free comprehensive guide](http://www.leadinggroupsonline.org/#order).


## Facilitating online

Running group sessions online may be the best way to have conversations. [Outside the Box](https://otbds.org/) has put together a  fantastic set of tips for keeping inclusion, rights and diversity at the heart of our online community events. 


### Inclusive online events: our top tips


## Adapted from Outside the Box guidance (19 May, 2020)  '[Outside the Box'](https://otbds.org/inclusive-online-event-tips/)


#### Accessible communication

Make sure your communication about the event is available in plain text. See our [blog on online access](https://otbds.org/online-event-tips/) for some more tips. Birds of Paradise Theatre has an [Accessible Marketing Toolkit](http://www.boptheatre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BOP-Marketing-Toolkit.pdf) with lots more information.


#### Different ways to take part

Respect that people have different needs and might participate in different ways. Be flexible and non-judgmental when people don’t engage in the way you expect. Let people choose what works best for them.


#### Explain how the event will work

Sharing what will happen and how to take part in the event can help people feel confident. Give participants the information they need before the event, or as it begins. Share the agenda or event plan, and any ‘online etiquette’ like muting your microphone when not speaking.


#### Introduce yourself with your name and pronouns

Just like in person, introducing yourself is a chance to set a friendly, welcoming tone. Share a little about who you are and what you do. Some groups really appreciate when event hosts share their gender pronouns. You can do this aloud or by changing your name in the online call. If you have a pet cat or dog you could introduce them too!


#### Give people low-stress ways to engage

Taking part online can be overwhelming,  so try not to put people on the spot. People might benefit from listening, even if they are not up for speaking. Think about including one-to-one chats, individual reflections, and games which use visuals or movement rather than dialogue.


#### Intersectional thinking about inclusion

People bring their whole selves into events, including multifaceted identities which shape their experiences. For example, disabled women’s experiences of sexism in society don’t happen in isolation to their experiences of disability. Those experiences are also affected by factors like age, religion, sexuality and economic position. Removing barriers means thinking about how forms of privilege and oppression intersect. Listen to people, and don’t assume you know everything about their identities and experience.


#### Comfort breaks

It’s important to give people the chance to get a drink, go to the bathroom, stretch – whatever they need to be comfortable during the event. There should be fifteen minute break  at least every 2 hours. You can also encourage participants to drop in and out, or step away from the screen when they need.


#### Use content warnings and encourage choice

If the event content  or  conversation touch on sensitive topics that could be upsetting or triggering, it’s best practice to let everyone know in advance. Share a written or spoken ‘content warning’ so people know what topics will come up. Try to make it easy for participants to opt-out of activities and choose how to take part.


#### Content which reflects everyone’s needs

The content should be useful and interesting for everyone who might take part. Try to choose activities and discussion topics which participants don’t need special background knowledge or skills for. If you use images, videos or stories, think about how your media choices can reflect and value the diversity of communities.


#### Balancing who speaks 

It’s important that everyone has an equal chance to share and be heard. As we can’t sense body language as well online, it can be harder to know when to start and stop talking. Sometimes politely interrupting to move the conversation on is ok.

Think about making participation easier for people who feel less confident in the group. You could do a circle round, use small groups (like Zoom meeting rooms) or invite input by chat.


#### Starting the online event

Joining online events can be confusing, especially if it’s for the first time. There are a few ways to make it comfortable for everyone while you’re setting up and starting the event.


##### Supporting participants to join the event



*   Welcome people warmly as they join. Think about creating positive first impressions of the event – does it look friendly? Is key information communicated in a helpful way?
*   People might join at different times. You could share a warm-up activity that people can do while waiting for the event to start – such as introducing themselves in the chat.
*   If there are two facilitators, one could respond to questions in the chat and help participants join in.


##### How to take part



*   If you’re using slides, the first few slides can explain the online etiquette for the event. For example, asking everyone to ‘mute’ their microphones when not speaking.
*   Be clear and explicit about what’s expected. For example, participants might not know whether it’s ok to interrupt, or if they should stay for the whole event. Let people know the plan for the event, how they can interact and ask questions, and what time breaks will be. This can help if anyone’s feeling uncertain about how to take part.
*   ‘ I appreciate when the unspoken rules and expectations about how to take part are made clear. It’s also helpful when participants get a chance to suggest changes which could make it easier to take part.’ - Leon, Outside the Box
*   You could create space to discuss any hopes and expectations for the event, as well as what everyone can do to make it go well. This can be a good space to talk about what respect and equality mean in practice, and to address any barriers in the space.


##### Creating a caring group dynamic



*   Wherever they take place, events should be safe and enjoyable for everyone. Try to create events which value and nourish everyone’s contribution.
*   Include Icebreakers and comfort breaks
*   Warm-up activities can get people engaging with each other and their environments. As well as building a friendly group dynamic, this can make online events feel a bit less virtual.
*   Short introductions or reflections in a circle: give everyone a prompt, like ‘your name, gender pronouns, and one thing you’ve enjoyed this week’. Pass to the next person by name.
*   Check in with pictures: ask everyone to draw a face, picture of weather (sunny, rainy, etc.) showing how they’re feeling, and then share it with the group.
*   Ask people to touch something in their environment which is: green, pink, cold, soft, spiky etc. Everyone shares the last example with the group.

As you would offline, set a 5-10 minute break roughly every hour and encourage people to stretch, get tea, or do whatever they need to engage comfortably. This can make it easier for people balancing caring responsibilities or other tasks  at home. 

Addressing barriers to feeling included



*   Creating an inclusive dynamic can often involve addressing imbalances in power and access in the group. When planning an event, reflect on who it will work best for and who might experience more barriers. How will the event include people who are less connected in the community already, or have more difficulties getting online? Work together with people who are experiencing barriers or feeling less included to find solutions they think could work.
*   It can be harder to read peoples’ emotions and energy levels in virtual events. Take care around activities which touch on difficult experiences or situations. If possible, have an extra facilitator on hand to support people, [Training for Change’s online facilitation](https://www.trainingforchange.org/tools/?topic%5B2%5D=2&searchbox=) tools include ideas for checking in with groups’ emotions online.
*   Finally, use content warnings. As in offline events, make it clear or ask permission before sharing content which might be triggering or upsetting to participants.


## Ideas for creative engagement

There are lots of ways that you can work with your group to elicit ideas and create connecting conversations. These range from quite traditional ways of working to things that are a little more out of the box.  We have come up with some ideas – have a think about how they could be applied to your project. You can treat this as a springboard for your own way of doing activities. 



*   Photography. You can use photography in many ways to help collect information, research and gain  insight into the day-to-day lives of your  group. There are digital and analogue ways of doing this. You can ask people to use their mobile phones to take pictures and transfer the files to you using WhatsApp or email. You can also post disposable cameras to participants and ask them to use them and send them back to you for development. The way in which you use photography can be different depending on your project aims. Get inspired by exploring projects by [Photovoice](https://photovoice.org/). 
*   Diaries and journaling.  Writing is a great way for people to share their ideas and thoughts in a group. You can ask group members to take part by keeping a journal or a structured diary for any length of time depending on the needs of your project. It is important to consider what kind of diary would suit the group. It could be visual, video, photo based, written, or spoken and recorded as voice notes on a phone etc. Be clear about what you will do with the content of the diaries and make sure that you are clear about consent practices around people's work.  It is important when it comes to diaries and journaling that you are in regular contact with your group to encourage them to stay motivated to complete the tasks. Part of this will come from their awareness of the value of the project and the way in which their work is going to contribute. Get inspired by The Scottish Recovery Network’s [Write to Recovery](http://www.writetorecovery.net/) project.
*   Interviews. you can use interviews in your group in a formal or informal way to gather information and share experiences. Group members can interview one another. It can be helpful to frame this within an exercise that gives clear boundaries in order to give people confidence. You can also do interviews by email, for example, that gives people time to think about and write out their responses. This can pose challenges for some people and can be a lot of work. The most common way to conduct interviews is to do so by phone, mobile or landline, or through your laptop or smartphone using WhatsApp, Skype or even texting. 
*   Video. You can use video in lots of ways with your group to encourage participation and share progress. You could ask participants to submit video blogs, to video things in their day-to-day life if they are relevant to the project, or to video interview one another. You can also use video to share the activities you would like participants to do or even track your project progress using a YouTube channel or other video sharing platform.  It may be that your project has specific aspects that could incorporate video. For example, projects exploring safe cycling could use cameras, such as a GoPro camera to video people's cycling experiences. Video platforms such as TikTok can be fun too.
*   Apps. There are lots of different apps available for all kinds of situations and experiences. It may be that your project could benefit from the use of an app. For example apps, like Strava that track where your participants go on a walk – what they do could be a really useful way of prompting discussion and engaging people. This obviously has to be a measured approach and it would be important to consider the use of people's data and how to manage it.
*   Cultural probes. The idea of cultural probes comes from design research. It is a technique used to inspire ideas and give insight to direct design processes. They serve as a means of gathering inspirational data about people's lives, values and thoughts. They often take the form of physical objects or kits that are posted to participants that they can then complete in their own time. You can get really creative with cultural probes and incorporate many other methods that we have discussed in your cultural probe kit. You can create a cultural probe yourself in a very basic way that contains objects that you may have around you in the office or or can buy cheaply. You could also –  if you have the budget to engage a designer to support you – create bespoke cultural probes that will help your project and align with your branding. While it can be nice to have slick and well designed products, the value of the information you get back will not necessarily depend on this. It is more likely to be linked to the level of engagement that people feel and how well supported they are to participate.

# Making ideas reality

By the end of this unit you will have completed exercises that explore:



*   Project planning timeline - using the timeline tool to visually map out what you will need to do, when, and what resources you will need to do it. 
*   Evaluation -  how will you measure the success of the project?

Now that you have all of the components of your project in place, it’s time to start thinking about how they all fit together. In this unit we will consider a project timeline to help you understand how long a project might take. We will also explore how you can define the outcomes of a project and evaluate them. In addition to the timeline, we will think about the budgetary requirements.

It can feel daunting to put down these final aspects of our project planning. However, you have worked through the other units and you are well equipped to begin putting your jigsaw puzzle together to complete the finished picture. You do not need to get everything perfectly planned or stick rigidly to this plan. This is more focused on thinking through each aspect of your project.  It will help you spot things you might have missed in your planning. It is also a good guideline to keep you moving forward into the more involved aspects of the project.


## Project planning timeline

It’s useful to use the Design Council’s Double Diamond model (Design Council, 2017) to structure co-production workshops. The model has four stages, which can be enacted over a few hours, or over a few years, depending on the project scope and resources.

**Discover **- investigate the focus of the project from all angles. Collect information through conversation, sharing stories, surveys, observations, interviews, drawing, creative exercises and other investigative techniques.

**Define **- examine all of the collected information and identify key themes that have emerged from it. By the end of this stage there should be a clear question, or questions, to be answered.

**Develop **- find as many answers as possible to the question - thinking broadly and not ruling anything out. The group must push themselves to think creatively in order to develop as many solutions as possible.

**Deliver **- ideas that have been developed are prototyped (tried out) and refined. This results in the group achieving the desired outcome or output.

Let's say you know you want to deliver a project involving a number of workshops. Using the timeline tool, visually map out what you will need to do, when, and what resources you will need to do it. Working on a visual timeline means you can easily add things as they appear to you, and don't need to worry about working everything out in chronological order. 


### How to use the timeline

Add your workshops to your timeline, spread evenly across the Double Diamond stages. You can either write down exact dates or just note a rough time between each session. The length of your workshops will vary from group to group. 

Now think about the steps you will need to go through for each workshop - identifying resources, planning resources, updating  group members, evaluating and documenting.  Add all of these actions to your timeline. 

Work backwards from there - think about advertising the workshops, recruiting your co-design team, networking, and sharing your workshops with appropriate colleagues. You may need to go back as far as sourcing funding.

When you have all the details of your plan timetable agreed, use the lower half of the diagram to map out what resources you will need at each stage and the associated tasks.

Map out who will do what tasks, and what support they will need.


### Evaluation

In your visual timeline, consider important points for evaluation and evidencing. Include the points at which you will determine personal outcomes, measure people’s understanding, take stock of what is being learned from the project, edit photographs and write up workshop reports.

Ideas for evidencing and sharing your work:



*   Take photographs throughout the workshops
*   Create a project blog or website
*   Write up all workshop notes at the end of each session
*   Evidence the narrative - write creatively about the workshops and project
*   Keep photographic or reflective journals
*   Storyboard events
*   Issue regular feedback forms
*   Tweet about your workshops
*   Interview participants at different stages
*   Speak at events about your projects
*   Create a folder or scrapbook to store used tools
*   What indicators can you use to demonstrate project progress/success?


### Practical exercises

Project planning timeline - using the timeline tool, visually map out what you will need to do, when, and what resources you will need to do it. 

Exploring evaluation -  how will you measure the success of the project?

# Your project plan

This course has focused on how you can create space for collaborative working when you cannot be physically together with people. By working through the course and completing the activities at the end of each unit, you will now have a project plan that includes the following completed exercises:



*   Project values - what makes your project unique and what success looks like. 
*   Expressing your values - thinking about ways to communicate your values. When we are working on projects that will be remote, it is really important to consider how we can make then stand out. 
*   The drivers of your project: gaps, strengths, risks - work through the following conversation prompts with your project team or on your own.
*   Your asset bank - what resources you already have to support your remote project idea
*   Power dynamics - in terms of your project focus, who tends to be impacted by decisions that are made, and who tends to make those decisions?
*   Who is who? - who will be involved in the project
*   Addressing power imbalance -  identify barriers to inclusion and ideas for overcoming them
*   Trust builder - effective group working  is about relationships and trust. This is even more crucial if you will be working remotely.
*   Staying connected - for a remote project communication strategy there are many different digital tools that you can use to  facilitate your project and stay connected. 
*   Digital comfort zone - reflect on how you could do some more focused learning to help build your confidence with digital tools.
*   Create a cultural probe - cultural probes work by revealing small insights into peoples’ lives, which can then inspire a group to come up with new ideas. 
*   Session plan - a place to think about and plan your individual sessions.
*   Project planning timeline - using the timeline tool, visually map out what you will need to do, when, and what resources you will need to do it. 
*   Exploring evaluation -  how you will measure the success of the project

In addition to this practical project plan, you will have a greater understanding of how to make distance working more accessible, inclusive, meaningful and rewarding. You will also have a better understanding of the landscape of tools and technologies that are available to support your work. Well done!
